## Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) Framework

The **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework** introduces an innovative reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic portfolio optimization in quantitative finance, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods like **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)** and predictive machine learning models.

### Key Features:

- Neural network-based actor-critic architectures dynamically allocate portfolio weights.
- Learns from both historical and real-time market data.
- RL agent interacts with a simulated financial environment to:
  - Process multi-dimensional inputs.
  - Optimize performance through a risk-sensitive reward mechanism.

### Network Architectures:

#### Policy Network:

### Innovations:

1. **State Representations**:
   - Integrates technical indicators and price trends.
2. **Action Spaces**:
   - Facilitates dynamic weight adjustments.
3. **Reward Functions**:
   - Balances returns with risk metrics.

### Experimental Results:

- **Datasets Evaluated**:
  - SP 500, Nasdaq, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and cryptocurrency markets.
- **Performance Achievements**:
  - 25.7% increase in cumulative returns.
  - Sharpe ratio: 1.45.
  - 15% reduction in portfolio volatility.
- Outperforms benchmarks like **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**.
